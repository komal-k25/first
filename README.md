# Flask Application: Simple Route Example

## Overview
This is a basic Flask application demonstrating how to create routes and handle both `GET` and `POST` requests. The application includes several routes that return simple text responses.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Flask (install using `pip install Flask`)

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd <repository-directory>
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
    ```bash
    pip install Flask
    ```

3. **Run the Application**
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

## Application Structure
The application is defined in a single file, `app.py`, and includes the following routes:

### Routes

1. **`/` (GET)**

    - **Description:** This route returns a simple greeting message.
    - **Response:** `"hello world"`

2. **`/sit1` (GET)**

    - **Description:** This route returns a message expressing enthusiasm for "SIT".
    - **Response:** `"SIT rocks!"`

3. **`/sheela` (GET)**

    - **Description:** This route returns a message with Sheela's age, using a stored value.
    - **Response:** `"sheela ki jawani umar {stored_age}"`

4. **`/sheela/<age>` (GET)**

    - **Description:** This route returns a message with Sheela's age based on the value passed in the URL.
    - **Response:** `"sheela ki umar {age}"`

5. **`/sheela/<cage>` (POST)**

    - **Description:** This route accepts a POST request and stores the provided age as `stored_age`. 
    - **Response:** `"done"`

## Usage Example

1. **Access the main page**:
   ```
   http://127.0.0.1:5000/
   ```
   - Response: `"hello world"`

2. **Access the `/sit1` route**:
   ```
   http://127.0.0.1:5000/sit1
   ```
   - Response: `"SIT rocks!"`

3. **Set Sheela's age using POST**:
   ```
   POST http://127.0.0.1:5000/sheela/25
   ```
   - Response: `"done"`

4. **Get Sheela's age**:
   ```
   http://127.0.0.1:5000/sheela
   ```
   - Response: `"sheela ki jawani umar 25"`

   Alternatively, you can set and access Sheela's age directly by passing it in the URL:
   ```
   http://127.0.0.1:5000/sheela/30
   ```
   - Response: `"sheela ki umar 30"`

## Notes

- The `/sheela/<cage>` route is designed to store Sheela's age, which can then be retrieved via the `/sheela` route.
- The `stored_age` variable is used to persist Sheela's age between requests. However, in a real-world application, storing such data in a global variable is not recommended, especially in a multi-threaded environment. Consider using a database or a session to manage state.
